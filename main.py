    This function performs the following tasks:
    - Simulates daily transaction data for an entire month using previously defined functions.
    - Identifies anomalies in both the number and value of transactions based on predefined thresholds. Two types of anomalies are detected:
        1. **Anomalies in the number of transactions per hour**: 
           - These are based on upper and lower thresholds derived from the average hourly transactions.
           - The average is calculated from accumulated data up to the current day, but anomaly detection is skipped for the first week to prevent false positives.
        2. **Anomalies in transaction values**: 
           - Detected when transaction values exceed or fall below specific thresholds.
           - The upper threshold is set at 4 times the average transaction value (calculated from all previous transactions).
           - The lower threshold is set at 100 euros, assuming any transaction below this is unusually small.
           - These thresholds are arbitrary and can be adjusted based on the characteristics of the dataset. Setting the upper threshold to 4x the average 
             and the lower one to 100 euros is a way to flag abnormally high or low transaction amounts.
    - Generates daily visual plots:
        - Displays both the average number of hourly transactions and the current day's transaction data.
        - Marks any detected anomalies for easy visualization.
    - Logs any anomalous transactions in a text file for record-keeping.
